/*
Following the approach of the Lissajous example in SectionÂ 1.7,
construct a web server that computes surfaces and writes SVG data to the client.
The server must set the Content-Type header like this:
	image w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "image/svg+xml")

	(This step was not required in the Lissajous example because the server uses standard heuristics to
	recognize common formats like PNG from the first 512 bytes of the response,
	and generates the proper header.)
	Allow the client to specify values like height, width, and color as HTTP request parameters.
